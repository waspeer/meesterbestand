  <p>Electron app for keeping track of ableton projects</p>
</div>

This is a work in progress for an Electron app for keeping track of Ableton Live projects.

It's far from finished at the moment (because I started over at some point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but the code is documented with JSDoc and tests if you'd want to check it out. It's build with Typescript and my personal [DDD library](https://github.com/waspeer/forestfire-core).

The features it will have are:

-   Keeping track of which projects might need a 'Collect all and Save'
-   Making sure you know where your projects are (on your machine or on some backup disk)
-   Keeping a list of projects that are special
-   Keeping notes on projects
-   Playing audio exports of projects
